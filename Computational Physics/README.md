The work I completed for my computational physics course.

Course Description:
Fifty years ago, running experiments meant setting up a laboratory and waiting for phenomena to unroll. Nowadays, we
can run an experiment in a perfectly controlled environment by creating a small universe in our local computer governed
by the rules we code in our programs. This means faster data collection and reproducible results with which to compare
our theoretical expectations to. This tutorial will explore simulations of physical systems and topics that can include
planetary orbits, propagation of heat along a metal bar, condensed matter systems and the renormalization group among
others
